#Chapter 3: Visualizing and Exploring Data

## 3.1: Intro
Exploring data is one part of analysis that goes hand in hand with hypothesis
testing. This drives *data driven hypothesis testing* such that it creates
a visual aid to show relationships that may later be explored statistically in
hypothesis testing.

It is also important to remember that sample size is an influencing factor.
The size of a population influences the mean of the sampled population due to
random variability. The larger the sample size, the more the sample will 
converge onto the true mean. There will be a more significant difference
between larger and smaller sample sizes.

Due to sampling bias, it is difficult to determine if a pattern is due to the
size of a sample or the inherent nature of a population. Thus, it is important
to sample the original sample to conduct formal testing.

## 3.2 Data Summarization

The *mean* is the average of values.

The *sample mean* is the average of values within the sample.

The *median* equates to a location of which has an equal quantity of data above
and below the data point of interest.

Quartiles identify each portion of the data in fourths.

Standard deviation and variance define how far a data point varies from the
mean.

## 3.3 Tools for displaying single vars

### Histograms
Some of the disadvantages of histograms, specificity of bins, have been 
corrected by smoothing kernels. 

for smoothing kernel example:

Usually K is a gaussian function.

As h, bandwidth increases, smoothness increases.

As t decreases, smoothness increases.

### Box and whisker plots

These are useful if there is more than one group.
